# As plugins are usually packaged and distributed as a RubyGem,

# from a file in the source tree.  The next three lines make that happen.

  # want to ensure you have `aws-sdk` in a certain version.

  # If you only need certain gems during development or testing, list
  # them in Gemfile, not here.
  # Do not list inspec as a dependency of the train plugin.
